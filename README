Introduction
------------
LXiMedia is a multi-platform multimedia framework. Which is based around a
streaming media library, and provides a media player and a DLNA/UPnP based media
center application.


Compilation
-----------
To compile LXiMedia on a Linux machine, first ensure all development libraries
are installed. On a Debian based system (e.g. Ubuntu) this can be done from a
command shell with the following command:

# sudo apt-get install subversion debhelper dpkg-dev bash doxygen g++ gcc make
binutils-dev libasound2-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev 
libdvdnav-dev libswscale-dev libexif-dev libfftw3-dev libpulse-dev libqt4-dev 
libqt4-test libqtcore4 libqtgui4 libqt4-network libqt4-sql libqt4-xml libx11-dev 
libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxtst-dev libxv-dev qt4-qmake zlib1g-dev

Open a shell and enter the lximedia directory that was checked out above, run
qmake and make to build:

# cd lximedia
# qmake
# make

Building from source on windows is a little more involved. First, a development
environment is needed. For now only QtCreator is supported, but support for
Visual Studio (Express Edition) is upcoming.

All library dependencies for Windows are stored precompiled in the source
archive, so no libraries have to be downloaded or built.

Download and install the latest version of the QtSDK from 
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/ (Choose LGPL when asked). Make sure you install
the QtSDK in a directory without spaces.

Finish the installation and start QtCreator. Select ''File -> Open File or
Project'' from the menu. Then select the ''lximedia.pro'' file from the lximedia
directory that was checked out above. A ''project setup'' dialog pops up, select
the Qt for desktop version and click ''Finish'' to continue.

Next select ''Build -> Run qmake'' from the menu and wait until a green ''Build''
bar appears above the project button.

Next, select ''Build -> Build All'' from the menu to build the entire project.
This may take some time, press the ''Compile Output'' button to monitor the build
progress.
