Introduction
------------
LXiMediaServer can be used to play media files from a PC over a local network on 
a DLNA capable device (e.g. television, game console, media center).
LXiMediaServer aims at compatibility with a large range of devices by
transcoding all media to a standard MPEG2 stream that can be played on almost 
any DLNA capable device, also subtitles and audio language selection are 
supported. Furthermore, several common timing and synchronization errors in
media files are fixed on the fly while transcoding.


Compilation
-----------
To compile LXiMediaServer on Linux or Mac, first ensure all compilers and 
development libraries are installed. On a Debian based system (e.g. Ubuntu) this
can be done from a command shell with the following command:

# sudo apt-get install debhelper dpkg-dev bash doxygen g++ gcc make binutils-dev
cmake libvlc-dev libvlccore-dev uuid-dev

Open a shell and enter the lximediaserver source directory, run cmake and make to 
build:

# cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
# make

To build Windows binaries on Linux, install mingw. On a Debian based system this
can be done from a command shell with the following command:

# sudo apt-get install mingw-w64

Open a shell and enter the lximediaserver source directory, run cmake and make to 
build:

# cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=deploy/win32/Toolchain-i686-w64-mingw32.cmake 
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
# make
