Introduction
------------
LXiMedia is a multi-platform multimedia framework. Which is based around a set
of streaming media libraries, and provides a DLNA/UPnP based media center
application.


Compilation
-----------
To compile LXiMedia on a Linux machine, first ensure all compilers and 
development libraries are installed. On a Debian based system (e.g. Ubuntu) this
can be done from a command shell with the following command:

# sudo apt-get install debhelper dpkg-dev bash doxygen g++ gcc make binutils-dev
libasound2-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libdvdnav-dev 
libswscale-dev libexif-dev libfreetype6-dev libpulse-dev libqt4-dev libqt4-test 
libsmbclient-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxtst-dev libxv-dev 
qt4-qmake zlib1g-dev

Open a shell and enter the lximedia source directory, run qmake and make to 
build:

# cd lximedia
# qmake
# make

Building from source on Windows is a little more involved. First, a development
environment is needed, both QtCreator and Microsoft Visual Studio 2008  (Express
Edition) are supported.

All other library dependencies for Windows are stored precompiled in the source
archive, so no libraries have to be downloaded or built.

For QtCreator:

Download and install the latest version of the QtSDK from 
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/. Make sure you install the QtSDK in a directory 
without spaces.

Finish the installation and start QtCreator. Select ''File -> Open File or
Project'' from the menu. Then select the ''lximedia.pro'' file from the lximedia
directory that was checked out above. A ''project setup'' dialog pops up, select
the Qt for desktop version and click ''Finish'' to continue.

Next select ''Build -> Run qmake'' from the menu and wait until a green ''Build''
bar appears above the project button.

Next, select ''Build -> Build All'' from the menu to build the entire project.
This may take some time, press the ''Compile Output'' button to monitor the build
progress.

For Microsoft Visual Studio 2008:

Download and install the latest version of the Qt for Visual Studio 2008 from 
http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/. Make sure you install Qt in a directory without
spaces.

Next open a command prompt and and enter the lximedia source directory, run
configure.bat followed by the directory where Qt is installed:

C:\lximedia\> configure.bat C:\Qt

Next open lximedia.sln with Visual Studio and select ''Build -> Build Solution''
from the menu and wait for the build to complete.
