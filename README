Introduction
------------
LXiMedia is a multi-platform multimedia framework. Which is based around a set
of streaming media libraries, and provides a DLNA/UPnP based media center
application.


Compilation
-----------
To compile LXiMedia on a Linux machine, first ensure all compilers and 
development libraries are installed. On a Debian based system (e.g. Ubuntu) this
can be done from a command shell with the following command:

# sudo apt-get install debhelper dpkg-dev bash doxygen g++ gcc make binutils-dev
libasound2-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libdvdnav-dev 
libswscale-dev libexif-dev libfreetype6-dev libpulse-dev libqt4-dev libqt4-test 
libqtwebkit-dev libsmbclient-dev libx11-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxcb-image0-dev 
libxcb-shm0-dev libxcb-xinerama0-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxtst-dev 
libxv-dev qt4-qmake zlib1g-dev

Open a shell and enter the lximedia source directory, run qmake and make to 
build:

# cd lximedia
# qmake
# make

Building from source on Windows is a little more involved. First, a Qt
development environment is needed, QtCreator is recommended.

For QtCreator:

Download and install the latest version of the QtSDK from 
http://qt-project.org/downloads. Make sure you install the QtSDK in a directory
without spaces (for example C:\QtSDK\). Download the latest version of MSYS and
install it in the C:\QtSDK\Tools\MinGW\ directory. And download YASM for mingw 
and copy yasm.exe to C:\QtSDK\Tools\MinGW\bin.

Start QtCreator. Select ''File -> Open File or Project'' from the menu. Then
select the ''lximedia.pro'' file from the lximedia directory that was checked
out above. A ''project setup'' dialog pops up, select the Qt for desktop
version and click ''Finish'' to continue.

Next select ''Build -> Run qmake'' from the menu and wait until a green ''Build''
bar appears above the project button. This may take a long time as it will
build all library dependencies.

Next, select ''Build -> Build All'' from the menu to build the entire project.
This may take some time, press the ''Compile Output'' button to monitor the build
progress.
