Introduction
------------
LXiMedia is a multi-platform multimedia framework. Which is based around a
streaming media library, and provides a media player and a DLNA/UPnP based media
center application.


Compilation
-----------
To compile LXiMedia, obtain a copy of the source code and make sure the following
dependencies are installed:
    doxygen,
    g++,
    gcc,
    make,
    binutils-dev,  
    libasound2-dev, 
    libavcodec-dev,
    libavformat-dev,
    libavutil-dev,
    libswscale-dev,
    libexif-dev,
    libfftw3-dev,
    libpulse-dev,
    libqt4-dev,
    libqt4-test,
    libqtcore4,
    libqtgui4,
    libqt4-network,
    libqt4-sql,
    libqt4-xml,
    libx11-dev,
    libxext-dev,
    libxrandr-dev,
    libxtst-dev,
    libxv-dev,
    qt4-qmake,
    zlib1g-dev

For the Win32 platform installing the QtSDK and MSys is sufficient, precompiled
binaries of the dependencies are included in the source package.

When these dependencies are met, extract the source tree somewhere and run
'qmake -recursive -config release && make'
