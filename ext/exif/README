To compile libexif for Windows follow the steps below, note that for Linux the
libexif-dev package should be installed instead.

- Make sure MSYS is installed in the same directory as the QtSDK mingw
  installation and start a bash shell.

- Configure libexif using:
  ./configure

- In the QtSDK mingw installation directory; copy and rename mingw32-make.exe
  into make.exe.
  
- Run make and copy the libexif.a file to ext/exif/bin.win32.

- In the QtSDK mingw installation directory; remove make.exe again.
