To compile fftw for Windows or Mac OS X follow the steps below, note that
for Linux the libfftw3-dev package should be installed instead.

Mac OS X:
- Make sure XCode is installed and start a terminal.

- Extract the fftw sources somewhere and cd into the source directory.

- Configure fftw using:
  ./configure --enable-single --enable-sse

- Run make and copy the libfftw3f.a file to ext/fftw/bin.macx.

Windows:
- Make sure MinGW and MSYS are installed and start a MinGW bash shell.

- Extract the fftw sources somewhere and cd into the source directory.

- Configure fftw using:
  ./configure --enable-single --enable-sse --with-our-malloc16
  
- In the QtSDK mingw installation directory; copy and rename mingw32-make.exe
  into make.exe.

- Run make and copy the libfftw3f.a file to ext/fftw/bin.win32.

- In the QtSDK mingw installation directory; remove make.exe again.
