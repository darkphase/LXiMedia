<H1 CLASS="western">Quick start instructions</H1>
<P CLASS="western">This page will briefly describe the steps to take
to install LXiMediaCenter.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">System requirements</H2>
<P CLASS="western">LXiMediaCenter always transcodes (i.e. decode and
encode) media, even if it is already in a compatible format, this
means the minimum processor requirements are relatively high. The
processor needs to support at least SSE2 and it is not recommended to
use systems with less than 512Mb of RAM. It is recommended to use a
modern dual core processor or better for optimal user experience.
Video encoding is performed at a high bit-rate for high image
quality, therefore it is recommended to use a cabled network or a
modern wireless network (802.11n).</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Installation</H2>
<P CLASS="western">First, obtain and install the package for the used
operating system. After installation, the backend will be started and
can be managed through its web interface at address
<A HREF="/">http://localhost:4280/</A> or through the provided
frontend.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Connecting with a DLNA capable device</H2>
<P CLASS="western">There are several options to connect a DLNA
device, please consult the manual of the DLNA device for an overview
of all options that are available. A few generic options are
discussed below. 
</P>

			<P CLASS="western"><IMG SRC="connect-direct.png" NAME="graphics5" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=330 HEIGHT=91 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT>A
			direct connection with a PC can be established by directly
			connecting an Ethernet cable from the PC to a DLNA device, by

			<P CLASS="western" STYLE="border: none; padding: 0in"><IMG SRC="connect-network.png" NAME="graphics6" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=330 HEIGHT=91 BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT>A
			home network connection usually consists of a router, or a PC
			configured as a router, and one or more computers. In this case,
			the DLNA device can be connected directly to one of the “LAN”
			ports of the router with an Ethernet cable. The router should then
			automatically assign an IP address to the DLNA device using DHCP.

			a wireless access point or wireless router is available and the

			connection is also possible. Please consult the manuals of the
			DLNA device and wireless router for details on the configuration.

			situations where it is not convenient to have an Ethernet cable
			near the DLNA device, Network over power-line, or HomePlug,
			adapters may be a solution. These adapters are able to transmit a
			data signal over a home power-line, and can be used to replace an
			Ethernet cable. Note that, similar to wireless connections, the
			actual connection quality may vary depending on the circumstances.

</TABLE>
<H3 CLASS="western">Firewall</H3>
<P CLASS="western">In case a firewall is enabled on the PC, it needs
to be configured to allow the backend to communicate with DLNA
devices. On Windows systems, the default Windows firewall is
automatically configured by the installer. For other firewalls,
please consult the manual of the firewall software for details on how
to configure it. The backend receives incoming HTTP requests on port
4280 and receives and multicast SSDP messages to/from
239.255.255.250:1900. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Selecting media directories</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The directories that are published can be selected
from the <A HREF="/settings#mediaplayer">settings page</A> in the
“Media player” field, all media files in the selected directories
and sub-directories will become visible. By default, the backend
(lximcbackend) runs as a restricted user. On Linux the user and group
“lximediacenter” are created during installation for this
purpose, on Windows the “Local Service” user is used. This means
that all files that need to be accessed need to be accessible by this
user. On Linux this can be done by setting the read permission for
“other” users on the files and directories that need to be
accessed by the backend. On windows this can be done by adding
“Everyone” with the read permission set to the files and
directories that need to be accessed by the backend.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Configuring High Definition video and surround
sound</H2>
<P CLASS="western">For maximum compatibility only DVD quality video
with stereo sound is enabled by default, High Definition video and
surround sound can be enabled from the <A HREF="/settings#dlna">settings
page</A> in the “DLNA” field. Note that higher settings require
more CPU power and more network bandwidth. The “Letterbox”
setting will add black bars to the image if the aspect ratio does not
match, whereas the “Fullscreen” setting will zoom in and cut off
part of the image. The “High quality” setting will use more CPU
power but gives higher quality images than the “Fast” setting.</P>
<P CLASS="western">There are two separate transcode settings for
music. For example, the “4.0 Quadraphonic” setting can be used to
duplicate the front channels to the rear channels. Furthermore, the
“Add black video” setting can be used to add a video stream with
black images to simulate that a TV is switched off (audio only).</P>
