<H1 CLASS="western">Troubleshooting</H1>
<P CLASS="western">This page describes how to detect and resolve the
most common problems. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">LXiMediaCenter is not detected in the network 
</H2>
<P CLASS="western">The usual suspect in such a case is a firewall or
virus scanner. The installer should add an exception to the Windows
firewall, if this fails you have to manually configure it to allow
communication, please note that both the SSDP (UDP 1900) and HTTP
(TCP 4280) are required. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">If you have more than one PC available, you can
try installing LXiMediaCenter on another PC and test if the frontend
applications on both PC's can find each other (the frontend
application uses the same UPnP mechanism to detect all instances of
LXiMediaCenter). If the frontend applications can't find each other,
there is most probably an issue with a firewall or virus scanner that
blocks communication. But if they can, there is most probably an
issue with the network configuration of your media device (TV), in
this case consult the manual of the device. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">Manually adding an exception to the Windows
firewall 
</H3>
<P CLASS="western">This can be done by right-clicking “My Network
Places” in the Start menu and clicking “Properties”. Then
select “Local Area Connection” and click “Properties”, now
the “Windows Firewall” dialog pops up. In the general tab you can
see if the firewall is enabled. If it is, make sure the “Don't
allow exceptions” box is unchecked. Then click the “Advanced”
tab and press the “Settings” button in the “Windows Firewall”
group. Next click the “Exceptions” tab and check if there is a
“LeX-Interactive MediaCenter - Backend service” entry and if it
is enabled. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western">If there is no entry yet, one can be added by
pressing the “Add Program” button. In the “Add Program”
dialog, press “Browse” and browse to “C:\Program
Files\LXiMediaCenter\lximcbackend.exe” and press “Open”. Next,
press “Ok” and check if the newly added item is enabled and press
“Ok” again. 
</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Files are not visible from LXiMediaCenter 
</H2>
<P CLASS="western">By default, the backend (lximcbackend) runs as a
restricted user. On Linux the user and group “lximediacenter” are
created during installation for this purpose, on Windows the “Local
Service” user is used. This means that all files that need to be
accessed by LXiMediaCenter, need to be accessible by this user. On
Linux this can be done by setting the read permission for “other”
users on the files and directories that need to be accessed by the
backend. On windows this can be done by adding “Everyone” with
the read permission set to the files and directories that need to be
accessed by the backend.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Device can not play files</H2>
<P CLASS="western">Sometimes a device is not able to handle the files
sent by the backend. The transcoding settings can be modified from
the <A HREF="/settings#dlna">settings page</A> in the “DLNA”
field. Once a device has connected with the backend, a box will
appear for that device. This box has a “Show profile settings”
link, which shows a list of all supported DLNA profiles. If the
device does not work properly with the default selected profiles,
some of them can be deselected to hide these profiles from the
device.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Codecs</H2>
<P CLASS="western">LXiMediaCenter uses its own instance of <A HREF="http://ffmpeg.org/">FFMpeg</A>,
therefore there is no need to install a codec pack. Nor will
installing a codec pack harm the functioning of LXiMediaCenter.
Unfortunately this also means that custom installed codecs are not
recognized by LXiMediaCenter, only the codecs supported by this build
of FFMpeg are supported.</P>
<H2 CLASS="western">Wrong characters in subtitles</H2>
<P CLASS="western">When subtitles are provided in separate text files
LXiMediaCenter attempts to automatically detect the language and
codepage based on the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequencies">letter
frequencies</A>, this may sometimes fail and use an incorrect
codepage. The used codepage can be selected from the <A HREF="/settings#localization">settings
page</A> in the “Localization” field, the autodetection is
enabled when the default codepage is set to “System”.</P>
