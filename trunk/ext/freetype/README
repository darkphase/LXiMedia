To compile freetype for Windows or Mac OS X follow the steps below, note that
for Linux the libfreetype6-dev package should be installed instead.

Mac OS X:
- Make sure XCode is installed and start a terminal.

- Extract the freetype sources somewhere and cd into the source directory.

- Configure freetype using:
  ./configure --enable-static --without-bzip2 CFLAGS="-mtune=generic -msse3 -mssse3 -mfpmath=sse"

- Run make and copy the objs/.libs/libfreetype.a file to ext/exif/bin.macx.

Windows:
- Make sure MinGW and MSYS are installed and start a MinGW bash shell.

- Extract the freetype sources somewhere and cd into the source directory.

- In the mingw installation directory; copy and rename mingw32-make.exe
  into make.exe.

- Configure freetype using:
  ./configure --enable-static --disable-mmap --without-bzip2 CFLAGS="-mtune=generic -march=i686 -mmmx -msse -msse2 -mfpmath=sse -mincoming-stack-boundary=2"
  
- Run make and copy the objs/.libs/libfreetype.a file to ext/freetype/bin.win32.

- In the mingw installation directory; remove make.exe again.
