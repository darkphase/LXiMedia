To compile fftw for Windows follow the steps below, note that for Linux the
libfftw3-dev package should be installed instead.

- Make sure MSYS is installed in the same directory as the QtSDK mingw
  installation and start a bash shell.

- Configure libexif using:
  ./configure --enable-single --enable-sse --with-our-malloc16
  
- In the QtSDK mingw installation directory; copy and rename mingw32-make.exe
  into make.exe.

- Run make and copy the libfftw3f.a file to ext/fftw/bin.win32.

- In the QtSDK mingw installation directory; remove make.exe again.
